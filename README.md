Current iptables rules can be saved to the configuration file /etc/iptables/rules.v4. These rules will then be   │
  │ loaded automatically during system startup.                                                                      │

  │ Rules are only saved automatically during package installation. See the manual page of iptables-save(8) for      │
  │ instructions on keeping the rules file up-to-date.                                                               │
